        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <section class="intro-section">
            <p>Nestled in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Routt Distillery is a small, family-run operation with a big passion for crafting unique local spirits that embody the rugged spirit of the Rocky Mountains. We work closely with our farmers and maltsters to source the finest Colorado-grown grains, ensuring every bottle reflects the land we love. After distilling, our spent grain goes to Hayden Fresh Farm, where it feeds their pigs and chickens, supporting local agriculture and sustainability. Each sip tells a story of quality, creativity, and our deep connection to the community.</p>

From distilling to bottling, every step is a hands-on family effort, infused with laughter, hard work, and pride. We can’t wait to share our passion—and our spirits—with you.</p>

                <h2>Meet the Distiller</h2>
                <p>I’m Brad, the owner and distiller at Routt Distillery, where I channel my lifelong love for creating into every bottle we produce. With a Masters in Food Studies from NYU and a PhD in Economic Geography from UC Davis—where I dove deep into the wine industry and high-value agricultural regions—I bring a unique perspective to distilling. My journey began at Davis with my first distilling course, igniting a passion that burns brighter with every batch. Making unique products and sharing them with others is what I love to do. From our small-batch whiskeys to our one-of-a-kind gins, I pour my heart into every drop, delivering flavors that stand out and tell our story.</p>
